### Working With the Lists.
After knowing how to create and access data using lists I started working with lists using some methods.

These are some of the new methods I got to learn.
> .count() - A list method to count the number of occurrences of an element in a list.

> .insert() - A list method to insert an element into a specific index of a list.

> .pop() - A list method to remove an element from a specific index or from the end of a list.

> .range() - A built-in Python function to create a sequence of integers.
 
> len() - A built-in Python function to get the length of a list.

> .sort() / sorted - A method and a built-in function to sort a list.

I also got to know the concept of slicing the lists.
I used all these methods and built a program [working_with_lists.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/working_with_lists.py)

Reviewing all the concepts I learnt in just one program was challenging and exciting at the same time.
