title: "Learning about lists"

After doing [Magic_8_ball.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/Magic_8_ball.py) I used the concepts of control flow and tried to do another project [shipping.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/shipping.py) which has several options for the customer to choose between different kinds of shipment based on their prices.

Then, I started **lists** in python. A list is one of the many built-in data structures that allows us to work with a collection of data in sequential order.

A basic example of list is,
>heights = [61, 70, 67, 64, 65]

We can also have an empty list,
>my_empty_list = []

access, add, remove and modify elements in the list
>  **.append()**, which allows us to add an element to the end of a list,
  
>  "+" to combine two lists,
  
>  we access the lists using the indexes in [] brackets,

> we can also access using negative indexing, like [-1] for the last element in the list and [-2] for the last second element in the list.

> We can remove elements in a list using the **.remove()** Python method.

I used all the concepts and did a basic program [lists.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/lists.py)
I also did a small project based on all these concepts, [gradebook.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/gradebook.py)

My goal was to complete all the concepts in lists and move on to next topic but, I couldn't do it. 

Hoping to get more time in the coming week.
