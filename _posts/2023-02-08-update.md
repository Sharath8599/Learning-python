## After learning the basics of python I started coding.
In [script.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/script.py), we will be storing the names and prices of a furniture storeâ€™s catalog in variables and then process the total price and item list of customers, printing them to the output terminal.
## Control Flow
I learned how to build conditional statements using boolean expressions, and manage the control flow in code.
Boolean expressions are of two types: True and False.
You don't need to use quotation marks for True or False. if you use quotation marks to declare True or False, python will take them as strings instead of **bool**.

The main part of control flow are **if, else, elif** statements.
I did a program using these in [if_elif_else.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/if_elif_else.py)

Control Flow also has relational operators like,
> greater than,
>= greater than or equal to,
< less than,
<= less than or equal to,

Boolean operators like, **and, or, not.**

I did a small program based on all these operators [boolean.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/boolean.py)

I also did a small project based on all these concepts,

Little Codey is an interplanetary space boxer, who is trying to win championship belts for various weight categories on other planets within the solar system.

A [space.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/space.py) program that helps Codey keep track of their target weight by:

#### Checks which number planet is equal to.
#### It should then compute their weight on the destination planet.

>## I also did one of the interesting projects for fortune-telling, [Magic_8_ball.py](https://github.com/Sharath8599/Learning-python/blob/main/code/Magic_8_ball.py)
In order for the answer to be different each time we run the program, I utilized randomly generated values. In Python, we can use the **.randint()** function from the random module to generate a random number from a range.
